            Say hi to our boy Jackaroney, nickname: Jack. He's a weird little dude. Look at his box. It's like, <em>empty</em> empty, but he won't let it go. Says he's gonna turn it into a time machine or some shit. Like I said, he's a weird one.
        </p>

        <div class="list">
            Things Jack needs for his time machine:

            <ul>
                <li>Foil</li>
                <li>Wires</li>
                <li>Copper Coils</li>
                <li>Mayonnaise</li>
                <li>LED Lights</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="ex-3">
        <p>
            Jack is gonna buy all the shit he needs online because he's a gen-z king. The blackmarket stores he likes to use are <a href="https://www.toysrus.com/">toysrus.com</a> and <a href="https://www.toysrus.com/">eToys</a>. Not too sure who his mayo dealer is though.

                    Existed, against my will. Me personally, I think I keep slaying though.

                    <em>2011</em><br>
                    Took on my first big role of being a prefect in primary school. Was hard work. Did not know what the hell I was doing most of the time and could not reprimand people because I didn't want them to hate me. Fun times.

                    <em>2016</em><br>
                    Reprised my prefect role, this time in high school. Honestly, I think I did a much better job this time around. I actually knew what I was doing. I was older and wiser. I didn't care about people hating me or not. Even more fun times.

                    There are, unfortunately, no prefects in University. I was, however, on the executive committee of the Muslim Students Association at Stellenbosch University. I was in charge of media and marketing, so I had mad access to all the social media profiles and shit.
                    I also formed part of the election committee, so I had a say in the selection of the new committee for the following year. That was probably the most fun I had in university ngl.

                    Girl, I tried working for real here. It was crappy, but I liked getting paid. All I did was make phone calls all day and get lectured by my boss because she was old and annoying as hell. 0/10, do not recommend, would never go back there.

                    Started my education journey at the young age of 3. Creche was a hard time for us all, but we got through it on peanut butter sandwiches and nursery rhymes.

                    Primary school. So lame. Don't really remember most of it, other than that I was in a spelling competition at one point, I was a prefect in grade 7, and I was always one of the top learners.

                    High school. Such a lit time honestly. Again, don't remember too much, other than making some dope ass friends, being a prefect, getting four distinctions, and always being a top achiever. I know, such a nerd I was. It be so sometimes.

                    Omg so many things are interesting to me, thank you for asking. I really like the outdoors, I like plants and shit. My dream is to own a farm where I grow fruits and flowers, and there are gonna be hella animals. I also like to crochet, but I'm not the best at it. It be so man. I like talking to people and interacting with them, hearing people's stories and shit. Love that. So interesting. Okay, that's all I can think of for now.
